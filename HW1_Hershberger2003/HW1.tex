Structural equation modeling (SEM) is a widely used statistical
procedure in psychological research. Over the past decades, SEM
applications are published in numerous research both substantive one
adopted SEM to analyze real data and the technical one that developed
new progress of SEM. Nowatoday, interests in SEM is high and continue to
grow (REF). Here, the present study reviewed the work doned by
Hershberger (2003), which reviewed the growth of SEM from 1994 to 2001,
to get a deeper understandings of the SEM progress in the literature. In
addition, several own perspectives about the paper (REF) and SEM
methodlogy itself are provided. In other words, the rest of the present
paper is organized as a quick review for Hershberger (2003), followed by
a series of proposed viewpoints and ends with a conclusion section.

Hershberger (2003) reviewed the growth of SEM from 1994 to 2001. They
used \emph{PsycIFO} database to locate journal articles published during
these seven years, and both substantive and technical research with SEM
techiques were identified. Also, they specifically examine the presence
of SEM papers in American Psychological Association (APA) journals.
Likewise, they examined the development of a SEM-specific journal,
\emph{Structural Equation Modeling: A Muvtltidisciplinary Journal},
during this period. The results showed the that number of SEM articles,
both the number of substantive articles and the number of techinical
articles, increased during this period. The technical articles that
published in \emph{Structural Equation Modeling: A Multidisciplinary
Journal} contributed as much as all other journals combined. Forty-seven
categroies were created to characterize the development of SEM
methodoloy. SEM was also identified to have the most consistently high
level of development relative to other multivariate statistical tools,
such as exploratory factor analysis. Overall, hershberger (2003)
suggested that SEM not only could be considered as the most popular tool
for multivariate method of data analysis, but also had a stable
methodological development with pace of the use in practical research.
